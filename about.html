                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>
                    Tiptoe Shoes was established in Australia in the early 1990s with a simple goal — to create 
                    comfortable and reliable footwear designed for everyday life. The brand was built around 
                    the needs of people who are constantly on the move, whether at work, at home, or outdoors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beginning as a small local business, Tiptoe Shoes focused on designing footwear that 
                    prioritised comfort, stability, and durability. Over time, the brand expanded its range 
                    to include walking shoes, casual footwear, and supportive everyday styles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, Tiptoe Shoes remains committed to designing footwear suited to Australian conditions, 
                    combining practical design with modern styling to support active lifestyles.
